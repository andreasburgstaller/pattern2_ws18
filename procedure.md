<h1>Topic: Advanced Feature Selection Algorithms</h1>

# Goal
Compare the performance of three different Feature Selection Algorithms based on a Neural Network whereas a smaller number of features is priorized.
The parameters of the Neural Network are adopted from the paper 'Short-Term Memory Mechanisms in Neural Network Learning of Robot Navigation Tasks: A Case Study' (Ananda et al., 2009).
The observed Feature Selection Algorithms are
1. 
2. 
3. 

# Data
As data we take the 'Wall-Following Robot Navigation Data Data Set' from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wall-Following+Robot+Navigation+Data.
Within the data set there exist 24 attributes (features) from sensors around the robot.

# Implementation
WEKA?
TENSORFLOW?

# Evaluation
The evaluation is based on the performance of the Neural Network.
